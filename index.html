        Prayagraj also known as Allahabad or Ilahabad, is a metropolis in the
        Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It is the administrative headquarters of
        the Prayagraj district, the most populous district in the state and 13th
        most populous district in India and the Prayagraj division. The city is
        the judicial capital of Uttar Pradesh with the Allahabad High Court
        being the highest judicial body in the state. As of 2011, Prayagraj is
        the seventh most populous city in the state, thirteenth in Northern
        India and thirty-sixth in India, with an estimated population of 1.53
        million in the city. In 2011, it was ranked the world's 40th
        fastest-growing city. The city, in 2016, was also ranked the third most
        liveable urban agglomeration in the state (after Noida and Lucknow) and
        sixteenth in the country. Hindi is the most widely spoken language in
        the city. The earliest mention of Prayāga and the associated pilgrimage
        is found in Rigveda Pariśiṣṭ . It is also mentioned in the Pali canons
        of Buddhism, such as in section 1.7 of Majjhima Nikaya , wherein the
        Buddha states that bathing in Payaga cannot wash away cruel and evil
        deeds, rather the virtuous one should be pure in heart and fair in
        action. The Mahabharata mentions a bathing pilgrimage at Prayag as a
        means of prāyaścitta for past mistakes and guilt. In Tirthayatra Parva,
        before the great war, the epic states "the one who observes firm vows,
        having bathed at Prayaga during Magha, O best of the Bharatas, becomes
        spotless and reaches heaven. "In Anushasana parva, after the war, the
        epic elaborates this bathing pilgrimage as "geographical tirtha" that
        must be combined with manasa-tirtha (tirtha of the heart) whereby one
        lives by values such as truth, charity, self-control, patience and
        others.

    <h2>TRIVENI SANGAM</h2>

      The Triveni Sangam in Allahabad is a confluence of 3 rivers, the Ganga,
      Yamuna, and Saraswati. Of these three, the river Saraswati is invisible
      and is said to flow underground and join the other two rivers from below.
      Here the muddy and pale-yellow waters of the Ganga merge with the blue
      waters of Yamuna. At times the Ganga is only 4 feet deep and the Yamuna is
      40 feet deep near the point of their nexus. The river Yamuna merges into
      the Ganga at this point and the Ganga continues on until it meets the sea
      at the Bay of Bengal. At the confluence of these two great Indian rivers,
      where the invisible Saraswati conjoins them, many tirtha yatris take boats
      to bathe from platforms erected in the Sangam. This, together with the
      migratory birds give a picturesque look to the river during the Kumbha
      Mela, in the month of January. It is believed that all the gods come in
      human form to take a dip at the Sangam and expiate sins.

      The Prayag Kumbh Mela, also known as Allahabad Kumbh Mela, is a mela, or
      religious gathering, associated with Hinduism and held in the city of
      Prayagraj, India, at the Triveni Sangam, the confluence of the Ganges, the
      Yamuna, and the mythical Sarasvati river. The festival is marked by a
      ritual dip in the waters, but it is also a celebration of community
      commerce with numerous fairs, education, religious discourses by saints,
      mass feedings of monks or the poor, and entertainment spectacle.
      Approximately 50 and 30 million people attended the Prayagraj Ardh Kumbh
      Mela in 2019 and Maha Kumbh Mela in 2013 respectively to bathe in the holy
      river Ganges, making them the largest peaceful gathering events in the
      world. The full Kumbh mela is held every 12 years, while an ardha (half)
      mela is held after about 6 years at the same site. The 2013 Kumbh mela was
      the largest religious gathering in the world with almost 120 million
      visitors. An Ardh Kumbh Mela was held in early 2019. The next full Kumbh
      mela is scheduled for 2025. The exact date is based on the Hindu
      luni-solar calendar and is determined by the entry of planet Jupiter in
      Taurus zodiac and while the sun and the moon is in Capricorn.

      Allahabad Fort at Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, India was built by Emperor
      Akbar in 1583. The fort stands on the banks of the Yamuna near the
      confluence with the river Ganges. It is the largest fort built by Akbar.
      In its prime, the fort was unrivalled for its design, construction and
      craftsmanship. This huge fort has three galleries flanked by high towers.
      Allahabad Fort is the location of the much revered Akshayavat or "immortal
      tree." Legends say that if anyone jumps from this centuries-old banyan
      tree he will attain immortality. Civilians are not allowed to see this
      tree. It is near the southern wall and is one among many trees that can be
      seen from outside the southern wall of the fort.

      At a distance of 6 km from Allahabad Railway Station, Mankameshwar Temple
      is a revered Hindu temple located on the banks of Yamuna River in the
      Cantonment area of Allahabad. Situated near the Saraswati Ghat, it is one
      of the most popular temples in Allahabad, and among the most visited
      places as part of Prayagraj Darshan. Also known as Pishach Mochan Tirtha,
      Mankameshwar Temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is maintained by Sri
      Shankaracharya Trust. Mankameshwar means the God of the fulfillment of
      wishes and the temple derives its name from an interesting legend. Goddess
      Sita desired to pray to Lord Shiva following her ritual bathing at the
      Sangam. Since there was no Lord Shiva temple in the vicinity, Lord Rama
      built this temple to fulfill her wish. It is still believed that wishes
      made at this temple are fulfilled.

      Anand Bhavan is a large mansion established by prominent Indian political
      leader Motilal Nehru in the nineteenth century. It served as the ancestral
      home of the Nehru–Gandhi family (late prime ministers of India, Jawaharlal
      Nehru and Indira Gandhi were born there). The premise stands as a mute
      testimony to the Indian freedom struggle. In 1970, Anand Bhawan was
      donated to the Government of India by Mrs. Indira Gandhi. This place was
      later converted into a museum at her behest. The exhibits inside the house
      highlight the events, which describes the participation of prestigious
      family in the struggle for independence. The most beautiful part of the
      museum is the bedroom of Nehru and his study.

      Allahabad High Court, officially known as High Court of Judicature at
      Allahabad, is the high court based in the city of Prayagraj, formerly
      known as Allahabad, that has jurisdiction over the Indian state of Uttar
      Pradesh. It was established on 17 March 1866, making it one of the oldest
      high courts to be established in India. Allahabad became the seat of
      Government of North-Western Provinces and a High Court was established in
      1834 but was shifted to Agra within a year. In 1875 it shifted back to
      Allahabad. The former High Court was located at the Accountant General's
      office at the University of Allahabad complex.
